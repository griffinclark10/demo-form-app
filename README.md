# Demo Form Application
This Demo Form Application serves as a showcase of basic coding and deployment capabilities, featuring a frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, and a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's a simple yet robust demonstration of a full-stack development project.

## Getting Started

The project is structured into two main directories: frontend and backend. The frontend leverages Next.js and TypeScript for an enhanced development experience and optimized performance. The backend is a Node.js server that initializes a MongoDB instance and an Express API.

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the Next.js Frontend
npm run start:frontend

# Start the Node.js Backend Server
npm run start:backend
```

The backend server runs locally on port 5000, and the frontend application is hosted on port 3000. To view the application, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Project Structure
Frontend: The web application's frontend code is located in the src/app directory. Here you can find all the React components, styles, and logic that make up the user interface.
Backend: The server logic and API endpoints are contained within the server.js file. This is where the Express server is configured, and the MongoDB database is managed

## Completion & Acknowledgement
